## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! I'm a UX/UI designer with a strong passion for improving accessibility in digital design. My work centers around creating intuitive, inclusive experiences that are usable by as many people as possibleâ€”regardless of ability, device, or context.

I believe that good design is not just about aesthetics or trendsâ€”it's about empathy, clarity, and making sure every user feels seen and supported. By integrating accessibility from the very beginning of the design process, I aim to craft interfaces that are not only beautiful but also functional for users with diverse needs, including those who rely on assistive technologies.

This repository is a space where I share design resources, accessibility guidelines, UI patterns, and code-friendly design files focused on inclusive practices. Youâ€™ll find documentation, prototypes, and examples of how accessible design principles can be applied to real-world projectsâ€”ranging from color contrast tools and keyboard navigation tips to ARIA usage and responsive design techniques.

Whether I'm designing for web, mobile, or cross-platform applications, I strive to make every interaction meaningful and easy to navigate. Accessibility isn't an afterthoughtâ€”it's a core part of my design philosophy.

I'm also committed to learning and sharing as the field evolves. Accessibility and inclusive design are ongoing conversations, and this repository is part of that dialogue. If you're a developer, designer, or anyone interested in creating better user experiences for all, I hope these resources can serve as helpful tools or inspiration.

Thanks for visiting! Feel free to explore, contribute, or connect. Together, we can make digital spaces more welcoming and accessible for everyone.
